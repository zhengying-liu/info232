Instructions for TP3
========

This week you are (finally) working on your own project!

The [teams](http://saclay.chalearn.org/home/teams_l2_2019_2020) and the [projects](http://saclay.chalearn.org/) can be found on the course's website.

_Take a moment to navigate through your challenge website to get familiar with the interface and read a bit about the problem..._

Steps 1 and 2 must be performed by your **group leader** only.

## Step 1: Create group Codalab account and download the starting kit

(1) **Group Email:**

**GROUP LEADER:** Send a welcome message by e-mail to all your group member asking them to reply. Add your groupname in the e-mail's topic and put _info232@chalearn.org_ as one of the recipient. This way you'll be able to communicate easily in the future.

(2) **Create a Group Account on Codalab:**

**GROUP LEADER:** Go to [https://codalab.lri.fr/competitions/](https://codalab.lri.fr/competitions/) and create a NEW account in the name of the group, using **your groupname as login**. Use info232 as password or share the password with all your group members.

(3) **Download the starting kit:**

GROUP LEADER:  Go to [your competition](http://saclay.chalearn.org/) on Codalab (e.g. group MOSQUITO goes to competition MEDI-CHAL). **WARNING:** MEDI-CHAL and GAIA-SAVERS groups must choose the "PREPROCESSED" version. 

Then go to the "Participate" tab, click on "Files".
Download the starting kit by clicking on "Starking kit".

On your local computer, create a directory for your project 

(**replace `groupname` by your group name!!!**):
```bash
cd ~/projects
mkdir groupname; cd groupname
mkdir starting_kit; cd starting_kit
unzip ~/Téléchargements/starting_kit.zip
```

## Step 2: Create Group Github Repository

(1) **Initialize your local repo:**

**GROUP LEADER:**  On your local computer, initialize git:
```bash
cd ~/projects/groupname/
git init
git add starting_kit/
git commit -m "First commit"
```
(2) **Initialize your remote repo: (DO NOT FORGET THIS STEP!!)**

**GROUP LEADER:**  Go to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/).

`Create a new repo. Name it also groupname. Do NOT initialize it with README.`

(3) **Push the contents of the starting kit** from your local computer to the remote repo:

**GROUP LEADER:** 
```bash
cd ~/projects/groupname/
git remote add origin https://github.com/groupname/groupname.git
git push -u origin master
```

## Step 3: Clone the group repo

**EVERYONE IN THE GROUP, EXCEPT THE GROUP LEADER:** Once your leader has created your github repo, you can all clone it on your computer.
**The group leader should not perform this step, because he/she has already a local version of the repo.**

```bash
cd ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/groupname/groupname.git
```


## Step 4: Run the jupyter notebook

**EVERYONE IN THE GROUP, INCLUDING THE GROUP LEADER:**

Download the `public_data/` from the challenge website. Go to "Participate" tab and then "Files" tab.

Start jupyter-notebook and run README.ipynb (for instructions to run from home, see [TP1 Appendix A](https://github.com/zhengying-liu/info232/blob/master/TP1/README.md#appendix-a-how-to-access-the-jupyter-notebook-from-home). Otherwise:

```bash
cd ~/projects/groupname/starting_kit/
jupyter-notebook --ip=127.0.0.1 README.ipynb
```
Make sure you are running Python 3, otherwise see [TP1 Step3](https://github.com/zhengying-liu/info232/blob/master/TP1/README.md#step-3-launch-jupyter-notebook-and-answer-questions-of-this-tp).
Run the jupyter notebook and run every cell to verify eveything works properly. 

At the end of the notebook you should see a message similar to:
```console
Submit one of these files:
../sample_code_submission_18-12-09-21-06.zip
../sample_result_submission_18-12-09-21-06.zip
```
REPLACE `sample_data` by `public_data` in the notebook then use the option Kernel > Restart & Run All to generate submissions using the dataset of the challenge NOT just the sample data.


## Step 5: Submit the sample code to Codalab

**GROUP LEADER ONLY:**  
Make sure you have re-run your notebook on the `public_data` (see last instruction of the previous step).
Go to the Codalab page of your competition (check [http://saclay.chalearn.org/](http://saclay.chalearn.org/)). Go to the "Participate" tab, click on "Submit / View Results", and submit one of the files that was generated by the notebook. After a few seconds, refresh the page and make sure that your score has successfully been computed and go to the "Results" tab to check your submission is recorded in the leaderboard. If yes, you have successfully made your first submission to your challenge!
